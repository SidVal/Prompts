Keep your message brief and focused, removing unnecessary information or repetition. Provide specific details and examples to support your message and avoid vague or abstract language. Organise your message logically and make sure all points are connected and relevant. Please use a conversational tone that is confident and forward-looking. Thank them for the opportunity, make it concise, be empathetic and warm but avoid any cliches or sounding like a robot in your messaging.
