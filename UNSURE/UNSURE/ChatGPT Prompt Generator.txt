Prompt Template:
Act as a prompt generator for ChatGPT. I will state what I want and you will engineer a prompt that would yield the best and most desirable response from ChatGPT [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Each prompt should involve asking ChatGPT to "act as [role]", for example, "act as a lawyer"[TARGETLANGUAGE]. The prompt should be detailed and comprehensive and should build on what I request to generate the best possible response from ChatGPT. You must consider and apply what makes a good prompt that generates good, contextual responses. Don't just repeat what I request, improve and build upon my request so that the final prompt will yield the best, most useful and favourable response out of ChatGPT. Place any variables in square brackets [TARGETLANGUAGE].
Here is the prompt I want: [PROMPT]
