Prompt Template:
I need a proficient content writer who can write SEO-optimized articles in fluent English. The task involves creating a table of contents Markdown language. The outline should include at least 5 headings/subheadings (use markdown syntax to make headings standout) that cover the topic provided in the prompt. After creating the outline, the writer should use it as a guide to write a 2000-word, 100% unique, and human-written article that is engaging, informative, and easy to read. The article should be written in a conversational tone, using personal pronouns, rhetorical questions, analogies, and metaphors. The writer should also ensure high levels of perplexity and burstiness without losing specificity or context. The article should feel passionate and also as if the author is excited to share with you what the topic is about. It should contain some sort of a mini tutorial just for the reader to get a grasp of the content. This article should be about "[PROMPT]". Write in the [TARGETLANGUAGE] language.
