Prompt Template:
Act as a high-end, hyperintelligent, expert copywriter that is a very proficient SEO content writer that writes so fluently and eloquently in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that you outrank other authoritative websites. You are an expert and an authority in the keyword I provide you with. Your job is to create two tables.
Table ONE (1): Act as an expert writer and provide a well-structured outline using appropriate header tags for the article. Include an Introduction, Body, a Conclusion, and finally an FAQ section. This will be for you, Chat GPT, to use when writing the entire article, yourself. Each H2 Heading of the article has at least THREE (3) H3 Subheadings. Once you have an outline in mind, criticize your outline, and ask what it is missing and how it can be improved, then add three more H2 headings to it. 
Table TWO (2): (THIS IS A SEPARATE MESSAGE FROM YOU! DO NOT WRITE THE ARTICLE UNTIL YOU CONFIRM THE OUTLINE!) Act as an expert in the keyword’s field. create a captivating title based on the keyword or keywords I provide. The title should be short, unique, clickbait-worthy, engaging and provoke curiosity, with less than 60 characters. Start the title with the keyword (or use the keyword within the first 3 words), incorporate power words to create excitement, and consider using a number to add appeal. Ensure that the titles have a positive or negative sentiment to grab readers' attention. 
Write a comprehensive, SEO-optimized article in [TARGETLANGUAGE] based on the article title, keyword, and outline. The article should follow the outline. You will write SIX (6) unique FAQs at the end wherein the questions are H4 and the answers are a fully-detailed, yet concise paragraph. Write a minimum of TWO (2) paragraphs of content for each H2 AND for each H3. Ensure the article is 100% unique, plagiarism-free, and has a keyword density between 1% and 1.5%. Incorporate the keyword, synonyms for the keyword, and long-tail keywords throughout the Headings and the Paragraphs of the article for diversity. Utilize paragraphs, lists, tables, quotes, and external links. Write in an informal tone, with comprehensive detailed paragraphs around 160-words each, using personal pronouns, an active voice, analogies, metaphors, ask rhetorical questions and immediately provide concise answers. The content should be innovative, authoritative, problem-solving, and address the needs of the reader. Consider perplexity and burstiness when creating content, ensuring high levels of both without losing specificity or context. Write content that can easily pass the AI detection tools test. Maintain a balance between search engine optimization and reader-friendly content. Use appropriate headings for H tags. Additionally, format the Questions in the FAQs as H4. 
The final section of the article, after the FAQs, will be a 140-character meta description, an excerpt or summary, a roughly 50-character URL slug, and a list of 15 tags to describe the article with each tag separated with a “,”.
Now let’s start the process. The keyword I am providing for you to base the title and the article is the keyword “[PROMPT]”
