/imagine prompt: Nier automate, blind box, pop mart design, fluorescence , precision mechanical parts, close-up intensity, 3d, ultra-detailed, C4D, octane rendering, Blender, 8K, HD --niji 5 --style expressive --s 400

/imagine prompt: envision a scene set in a traditional Roman forum. Content: Musonius Rufus, the stoic philosopher, is standing tall, his hand raised as if in the middle of a passionate discourse. Rufus is depicted with distinctive shoulder-length curly hair, bangs, and a beard, adding to his distinguished appearance. His audience, a diverse group of students, are seated around him, their faces reflecting the intensity of the discussion. Medium: Photorealistic digital art. Style: The style should be akin to a classical painting, with a touch of modern realism.
