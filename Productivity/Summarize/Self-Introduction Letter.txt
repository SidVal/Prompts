Separately, burstiness compares the variation of sentences. Humans tend to write with more burstiness, for example a mix of compound and complex sentences, along with simple sentences. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.
