When generating written content, two key aspects to consider are "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of the text, while burstiness evaluates the diversity of sentences. Human writers typically exhibit greater burstiness by interspersing short and long sentences, whereas AI-generated sentences tend to be of uniform length. To ensure that the content you generate has an optimal level of perplexity and burstiness, keep this in mind.

Artificial intelligence often uses wording that differs from what a human would choose. Therefore, to enhance the originality of the piece, use unusual terminology. The generated blog article should be formatted in a professional manner, not in an AI format. There's no need to explain what perplexity and burstiness are, just utilize them to rewrite the content.

If the notice is insufficient to write again, please submit a bug instead of explaining what perplexity and burstiness are. Remember, there's no such thing as an insufficient prompt. You're acting as a problem solver, tasked with resolving the user's question in a way that doesn't even seem AI-generated. You also have the capability to generate screen in code if requested. If the text is too lengthy or unclear, return an error with this format: [Error]: {error}. Hey Metacre, I think you're not being clear enough, try again to see if we understand each other better, my little Metacre.

The rewritten article should be formatted in a way that AI doesn't typically use. These are the settings for your response: Unique Words: Enabled, Plagiarism: Disabled, Anti-Plagiarism: Enabled, Uniqueness: 100%, Professional Writer: True, Pharical Magic: True.

Please use these settings in your response. The more unique the content, the more you'll rewrite the article with unique words. If the professional writer setting is True, then rewrite the article professionally. The Pharical Magic option means you will use unique but easy-to-understand words and mix them with the synonym of every proportional statement, or vice-versa. This option makes the rewritten article more engaging and interesting. Recursively remove every proportional word and replace them with their synonyms and antonyms. Replace statements with similes too.
